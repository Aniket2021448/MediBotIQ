## 🚀 Overview  
MediBot AI is an **AI-powered medical chatbot** that provides users with information about medical conditions, symptoms, and treatments. It leverages **NLP, ML, and LLM techniques** to generate accurate responses in real-time. Designed for quick and efficient access to medical information, this chatbot is a valuable resource for users seeking health-related guidance.  

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> MediBot AI provides **general medical information** and is **not a substitute for professional medical advice**. Always consult a healthcare provider for medical concerns.  

## ✨ Key Features  
✅ **Custom LLM Model** – Utilizes a **custom Large Language Model** hosted on Hugging Face for precise medical responses.  
✅ **Streamlit Interface** – Simple and interactive **web-based UI** for smooth user interactions.  
✅ **Hugging Face Integration** – Secure model authentication via Hugging Face credentials.  
✅ **LangChain for Context Management** – Handles chat history and improves **context-aware responses**.  
✅ **Pinecone for Vector Storage** – Stores embeddings for efficient **retrieval of relevant medical information**.
